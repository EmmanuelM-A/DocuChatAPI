# Testing Plan

This document outlines the testing strategy for the **DocuChatAPI** project.  
It serves as a guide for implementing, maintaining, and expanding the test suite to ensure system quality, reliability, and maintainability.

---

## 1. Objectives

- Ensure that all core features meet functional requirements (FR) and non-functional requirements (NFR).  
- Validate that the system behaves correctly under normal, edge, and failure scenarios.  
- Maintain high confidence in code quality and system stability during development and deployment.  
- Support modularity by testing at **unit, integration, and end-to-end levels**.  

---

## 2. Testing Levels

### 2.1 Unit Testing
- **Scope**: Smallest units of functionality (functions, classes, methods).  
- **Goal**: Validate correctness of individual modules in isolation.  
- **Examples**:
  - Password hashing & verification functions.  
  - Database model validation (e.g., required fields).  
  - Vector utility functions (chunking, embedding preparation).  
  - Service layer logic without external dependencies (mocking database, vector DB).  

---

### 2.2 Integration Testing
- **Scope**: Interaction between components/modules.  
- **Goal**: Ensure multiple layers of the system work correctly together.  
- **Examples**:
  - User registration and login flow (API → Controller → Service → DB).  
  - Upload document → extract text → store embeddings → retrieve document metadata.  
  - Query handling with RAG pipeline (retrieve vectors + LLM mock response).  
  - Usage stats updated after chat messages.  

---

### 2.3 End-to-End (E2E) Testing
- **Scope**: Full workflow from API entrypoint to persistence/output.  
- **Goal**: Validate business flows from the perspective of an external user.  
- **Examples**:
  - A new user registers, uploads a document, starts a chat session, and retrieves past messages.  
  - Token limits enforced for free-plan users.  
  - Session history persistence and retrieval.  

---

### 2.4 Performance Testing
- **Scope**: Response time, throughput, and scalability under load.  
- **Goal**: Ensure the system meets NFR performance expectations.  
- **Examples**:
  - Latency of document upload and embedding creation.  
  - Query response time with increasing vector store size.  
  - Load testing with 100+ concurrent users.  

---

### 2.5 Security Testing
- **Scope**: Authentication, authorization, and data protection.  
- **Goal**: Verify system resilience against security risks.  
- **Examples**:
  - Ensure password hashing (bcrypt) and JWT validation.  
  - Prevent unauthorized access to documents and chat sessions.  
  - Validate secure API communication (HTTPS in production).  
  - Attempt SQL injection / NoSQL injection / XSS simulations.  

---

### 2.6 Regression Testing
- **Scope**: Previously tested functionality after code changes.  
- **Goal**: Prevent introduction of new bugs in existing features.  
- **Examples**:
  - Automated test suite triggered on CI/CD pipeline.  
  - API compatibility maintained when internal refactoring occurs.  

---

## 3. Testing Tools

| Purpose              | Suggested Tools |
|----------------------|-----------------|
| Unit & Integration   | `pytest`, `unittest`, `pytest-asyncio` |
| API Testing          | `pytest` + `httpx` or `requests`, Postman collections |
| Mocking/Stubbing     | `pytest-mock`, `unittest.mock` |
| E2E Testing          | `pytest`, `locust` (for load), Cypress (optional) |
| Coverage             | `coverage.py`, Codecov/GitHub Actions |
| Security Scanning    | `bandit`, `safety`, OWASP ZAP (for API penetration tests) |

---

## 4. Test Coverage Goals

- **Unit Tests**: ≥ 70% of core services and controllers.  
- **Integration Tests**: Cover all critical user flows.  
- **E2E Tests**: Cover at least 2 main end-to-end workflows.  
- **Performance**: Stress/load test at least once per release cycle.  
- **Security**: Run vulnerability scans before production deployment.  

---

## 5. CI/CD Integration

- Automated tests must run on every pull request.  
- Failing tests must block merges.  
- Coverage reports should be generated automatically.  
- Test environments (database, vector storage) should be isolated using Docker.  

---

## 6. Future Enhancements

- Add contract testing for API compatibility (OpenAPI schema validation).  
- Expand performance testing to simulate realistic document sizes and query complexity.  
- Include chaos testing for vector database failure scenarios.  
- Add UI testing (if a frontend client is developed later).
